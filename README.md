As we know, C++ is a very complicated and hard to learn. However, with the help of STL(standard template library), we can use the C++ language more easily, so it is very important to know how to use STL. Let me tell you how to use STL!!

In c++, There is an important concept called generic programming, which means that we use template to deal with many data type, it is very powerful.

There are two type of template, fuction template and class template. STL is one kind of class template. In fact, STL contains three parts:
1. container: class template
